##  My agenda 

These are the sessions I'm interested in attending. I know there a lot listed in the same time slots, but I'm hoping to catch a few talks in different ones. The numbers at the beginning list the session number. FWIW, I have organized a late-breaking session on [Addressing Sexual Misconduct in the Statistics Community](http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=215487) on Mon 2-3:50pm, Rafael Irizary is giving an invited talk on a paper I co-wrote detailing a [Guide to Teaching Data Science](http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=215246) on Wed 10:30-12:20pm, and I'm giving a talk on [Missing Data in Single-cell RNA-Sequencing](http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=215111) on Thurs 10:30-12:20pm. Rafa and I are also giving a professional development continuing education courses titled [Data Science for Statisticians](http://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=215370) on Tues 1-5pm.
